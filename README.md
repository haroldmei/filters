## Tracking tech test sample code

This package contains sample code for the Nirovision tracking tech test.
You can use or modify any of this code when working on the tech test.

The `detections.py` file contains some example sets of detections that
you can use to test your tracking implementation.

The `show_detections.py` file is a program you can run to display these example
detections. It uses opencv to display images, so you may need to install
some system level dependencies. On Ubuntu you can use install the opencv dev
libs with `apt install libopencv-dev`, it should install all necessary dependencies.
